Pushing Metrics To Amazon Managed Prometheus Workspace
-------------------------------

Prometheus usually ingests metrics by scraping them from the configured endpoints. There is an
option to push metrics with a tool called Prometheus Pushgateway, where you can configure your
short-lived jobs to send metrics to the Pushgateway. This works well in situations where you have
jobs, that might not live long enough to be discovered by Prometheus.

Metrics that are pushed to Prometheus need to be in a Prometheus-compatible format.

Pushgateway with a Prometheus server in EKS
-------------------------------

Based on available data, you can configure a Prometheus server in EKS and setup a Pushgateway. 
You will push your metrics to the Pushgateway, which will then be scraped by the Prometheus 
server, and the server will do a remote_write to the AMP workspace, where you want your data
to be ingested.

From available data it seems that configuring the above is the recommended approach for pushing
data to an AMP workspace. It might be possible to setup the AMP managed collector to scrape the
metrics directly from the Pushgateway endpoint, but this needs to be tested.

AWS serverless Prometheus Push Gateway
-------------------------------

AWS Serverless Prometheus Push Gateway enables you to push metrics into Prometheus from any 
source without modifying your application or running an always-on service for Prometheus to 
scrape. This AWS CDK construct library deploys an AWS Lambda function using the Amazon 
Distribution for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) extension layer and connects it with an Amazon SQS queue 
and an Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) workspace.

##Lambda event payload:

!Sample-start
{
  "dimensions": {
    "customerId": "customer1"
  },
  "timestamp": 1676398017000,
  "metrics": {
    "temperature": "14.3",
    "ph": "6.7"
  }
}
!Sample-end

Properties:
    - dimensions: Key/value pairs of dimension names and values.
    - metrics: Key/value pairs of metric names and values.
    - timestamp: Timestamp in milliseconds since epoch.

##Metric type inference

Metric values can either be integers or floating point numbers. There is a risk that floating 
point metrics will be interpreted as integers by the JSON parser. To avoid this, we recommend 
sending metrics as strings to preserve the decimal point.

!Sample-start
{
  "metric1": 12.0,
  "metric2": "12.0"
}
!Sample-end

##Caveats

Amazon Managed Prometheus requires metrics for a given combination of labels to arrive in strictly ascending order by timestamp. Anything that arrives late gets rejected and dropped. In practice, as long as events for a given combination are sent on an interval of at most every 10 seconds, out-of-order messages are unlikely.

RemoteWrite
-------------------------------

The RemoteWrite operation writes metrics from a Prometheus server to a remote URL in a standardized format. Typically, you will use an existing client such as a Prometheus server to call this operation.

Valid HTTP verbs:
    POST

Valid URLs:
    /workspaces/workspaceId/api/v1/remove_write

RemoteWrite has an ingestion rate of 70,000 samples per second and ingestion burst size of 1,000,000 samples.

Sample request:

!Sample-start
POST /workspaces/ws-b226cc2a-a446-46a9-933a-ac50479a5568/api/v1/remote_write --data-binary "@real-dataset.sz" HTTP/1.1
