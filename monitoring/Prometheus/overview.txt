Overview
-------------------------------

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting tool. 

Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data. In other words, metrics 
information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside key-value pairs
called labels.

Features
-------------------------------

Prometheus's main features аре:
    - a multi-dimensional data model with time series data, identified by metric name and
    optional key-value pairs called labels
    - PromQL, Prometheus Query Language, that can be used to query the stored metrics
    - no reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous
    - time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP
    - pushing time series is supported via an intermidiary gateway
    - targets are discovered via service discovery or static configs
    - multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support

Components
-------------------------------

The Prometheus ecosystem consists of multiple optional components:
    - the main Prometheus server, which scrapes and stores time series data
    - client libraries for instrumenting application code
    - a push gateway for supporting short-lived jobs
    - special-purpose exporters for services like HAProxy, StatsD, Graphite and others
    - an alertmanager for handling alerts
    - various support tools

Most Prometheus components are written in Go, which makes it easy to build and deploy them as
static binaries.
