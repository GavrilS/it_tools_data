Remote-Write Version 1
-------------------------------

The remote write specification is intended to document the standard for how Prometheus and Prometheus remote-write-compatible agents send data to a Prometheus or Prometheus remote-write compatible receiver.

The remote write protocol is designed to make it possible to reliably propagate samples in real-time from a sender to a receiver, without loss.

The remote write protocol contains opportunities for batching, e.g. sending multiple samples for different series in a single request. It is not expected that multiple samples for the same series will be commonly sent in the same request, although there is support for this in the protocol.

The remote write protocol is not intended for use by applications to push metrics to Prometheus remote-write-compatible receivers. It is intended that a Prometheus remote-write-compatible sender scrapes instrumented applications or exporters and sends remote write messages to a server.

Some available remote-write senders:
    1. Prometheus itself
    2. The Grafana agent
    3. InfluxData's Telegraf
    4. The OpenTelemetry Collector
    5. The VictoriaMetrics Agent (not working on Mac OS X)
    6. Timber.io Vector
